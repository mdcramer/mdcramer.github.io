All journeys start with a little inspiration. This one begins with a [series of Tweets](https://twitter.com/bzotto/status/1353797383201558531) from [@bzotto](https://twitter.com/bzotto).

I wrote about [a game I wrote](https://mortalwayfare.com/in-the-beginning-there-was-basic/) in high school, and [giving up ever seeing it again](https://mortalwayfare.com/remnant-from-the-past/).
