All journeys start with a little inspiration. This one begins with a [series of Tweets](https://twitter.com/bzotto/status/1353797383201558531) from [@bzotto](https://twitter.com/bzotto). He tells a detailed story of how he restored, using custom hardware and software, and considerable gumption, a corrupted 5.25" floppy from elementary school. It contained a game that he wrote which he was able to salvage. I described [a game I wrote](https://mortalwayfare.com/in-the-beginning-there-was-basic/) in high school, along with [giving up ever seeing it again](https://mortalwayfare.com/remnant-from-the-past/). I decided to embark on a quest to see if I could get my game back.

## Poof
I chronicled [my odyssey](https://twitter.com/markdcramer/status/1460289742726217733) on Twitter, but I'll share the highlights.

After recovering the machine from my parent's house, where it had spent decades in the closet and then the garage, I brought it back to San Francisco. I had purchased a brand new set of [Apple DOS 3.3 floppies](https://www.ebluejay.com/ads/item/4249176) and was ready to see if it would boot. It turned on and did... something... but it did not look like it was working.

After playing around with it a bit (swapping the floppy drives), I was able to get the BASIC prompt. I entered and ran a 1-line "HELLO WORLD". Then I smelled something awful and saw smoke coming out of the PSU.

Not having been turned on for decades, the capacitors in the power supply dried out.
