## Why develop machine learning on an Apple ][+?
Everyone is aware of the impressive achievements of modern artificial intelligence and, more specifically, machine learning. Achievements.ai chronicles a growing list of AI milestones, but today virtually every industry has benefited from AI in one way or another. From medicine to entertainment to information retrieval to scientific discovery to agriculture, machine learning algorithms, powered by massive amount of data and computational power, have delivered unprecedented gains in efficiency and user value.

[Chip shortages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%93present_global_chip_shortage), however, exacerbated by the pandemic, trade wars, weather, fires and wars, have severely crimped our ability to deploy the compute necessary to train increasingly complex models. In times of scarcity we need to make the most of whatever resources are at our disposal. This requires creativity and gumption. As such, I am going to see what sort of machine learning I can do on my Apple ][+ computer from high school.

The [specifications of the Apple \]\[+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_series#Apple_II_Plus) are somewhat daunting:
* Processor: 6502 microprocessor running at 1.023 MHz
* RAM: 48Kb
* Storage: dual external 5 1‚ÅÑ4-inch floppy drives, each capable of storing 140Kb per side with DOS 3.3
* Programming languages: Applesoft BASIC and 6502 assembly

Nevertheless, these machines, which launched the personal computing revolution, can add and multiply arrays of numbers. As such, they can do machine learning. It is our duty, for the betterment of humanity, to make our best effort to deploy these machines in service of artificial intelligence. Let's see what I can do.
