As mentioned [at the beginning](/deep-speeling-blog/motivation-and-goals/), the first goal is to reproduce the results produced by Mr. Weiss. After implementing virtually everything in his post, including the [He normal initialization](/deep-speeling-blog/he-normal-makes-things-worse/), and building a highly similar model, the target of 90% accuracy (let alone 95.5%) is proving elusive.

I am thus going to start branching out.

## Removing non-English sentences from the dataset
It is critical to know the data set. It is also critical to clean the dataset, which is what data scientists [spend most of their time doing](https://whatsthebigdata.com/2016/05/01/data-scientists-spend-most-of-their-time-cleaning-data/).

Since the inception of this project I've been peaking into the and have noticed, despite the ".en" in the source filename, a considerable number of non-English sentences, like `Toujours aussi inconstant, le Brésil, tombé au 19e rang du classement FIFA, a certes réagi après l'ouverture du score de la tête de Gonzalez (7).` While I would imagine that a neural network could be trained to simultaneously correct spelling for multiple different languages, this will only increase the complexity of the problem. Additionally, only a smattering of different languages is going to be nothing more than noise. Thus, I've decided to scrub the data set of anything non-English.

Using [langdetect](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/langdetect) I constructed a routine to iterate through the entire file and remove any sentences that were not identified as English. In the process, I discovered a few things about langdetect:
* It is [not entirely accurate](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38752290/852795). Sentences like `You made it home!` return "fr". To mitigate this effect I used `detect_langs`, which returns a probability distribution of possible languages, and accept anything that has a non-zero chance of being English.
* It is not consistent. Repeatedly processing `Hello, I'm christiane amanpour.` returned `[it:0.8571401485770536, en:0.14285811674731527]` then `[it:0.8571403121803622, fr:0.14285888197332486]` and then `[it:0.999995562246093]`, all of which are incorrect, by the way. (It's unclear why "Christiane Amanpour" isn't capitalized, but that's the way it is in the source file.)
* It throws an error when processing text it cannot "identify," such as URLs and emails. This actually turns out to be a happy result since things like `http://abcn.ws/11JABPu` and `rswilloughby@pomlaw.com` are not going to help much with training, so it's good to get rid of them anyway.
* It is slow. It took 24 hours to process 21,688,362 lines, which works out to about 250 lines a second. I guess that's not too bad.

Perhaps my next project should be to build a language detection neural network. I digress.

In any event, the end result is that 848,326 lines, including 345 "errors," were removed from the source file. That's only 3.9% of the lines, however, after further processing to remove sentences that contain characters outside the top 75, the size of the source dataset dropped from 4,154,135 lines to 3,793,771, which is a reduction of 8.7%.

## That's the theory, anyway
The actual result, after two days of training, is disappointing. In my first run (orange-brown dots) I inadvertently also changed the minimum input size from 5 to 10, which had a pretty negative impact on training so I cut it short. It's often helpful to not change multiple things at the same time.

The second run (dark blue dots) actually did well, although not better than the run a couple weeks ago when I changed the number of allowable characters from 100 to 75 and before I implemented [He normal initialization](/deep-speeling-blog/he-normal-makes-things-worse/). The final validation accuracy was 70.0%. This is another disappointing result and I continued to be perplexed as to how Mr. Weiss got to 95.5% accuracy.

I have not yet, however, run out of ideas.
