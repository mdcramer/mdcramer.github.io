Or, more precisely, what's hiding in the search results for "Hillary Clinton"?

_How to Find the Needles in Your Search Results Haystack_

Enter a search for "Hillary Clinton" on your favorite search engine and the top results will often be bland, official stuff. So where's the beef?

Few people will bother to venture past the first results page. It's simply too much work. Nevertheless, given the enormity of information available on the internet, one has to imagine that there's a lot more good information out there, sometimes the most juicy stuff. Turns out, it's true!

Below we do the hard work for you and take a look at the top 100 results returned by Google for "Hillary Clinton." While one person's "[hidden treasure](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2008/02/18/hidden-treasures/)" is another person's buried garbage, it's instructive to see how much potentially relevant information there is beyond the first page.
