Anthony Ha at [VentureBeat](http://venturebeat.com/2008/06/12/surf-canyon-adds-craigslist-support-to-help-you-find-your-next-apartment/) helped us announce the latest version, and first major upgrade, of [Surf Canyon](http://www.SurfCanyon.com).

[v1.1.0](http://www.surfcanyon.com/search/versions.jsp) for Firefox includes support for the release version of Firefox 3 and both the Internet Explorer and Firefox extensions are now integrated with Craigslist. When searching through classified listings on Craigslist, in addition to benefiting from Surf Canyon's real-time relevancy calculations that pull forward pertinent results, displayed as "recommendations," users can get "preview" images of the listings on the results page, as depicted below. Both of these enhancements provide an enhanced search experience while trying to find the apartment, automobile or knick-knack desired. (If Surf Canyon recommends your future spouse, please let us know.)

The Preferences menu (under the "Tools" drop-down) has also been updated to enable turning the Craigslist integration on and off as well as adding the preview images.
