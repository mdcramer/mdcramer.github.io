Angela Gunn at [BetaNews](http://www.betanews.com/article/New_Google_tools_sift_and_sort_search_results/1225353991) gives an explanation and review of Surf Canyon:

> "The results are cleanly presented, and the recent addition of categories within results helps users to understand what the plug-in thinks you're seeking... results were intriguingly focused, and in a research situation SurfCanyon excels at winnowing the less-than-helpful."

Update (11/3/08) - Tim Conneally at [BetaNews](http://www.betanews.com/article/Semantic_search_plugin_comes_to_Google_Yahoo_MSN/1225720138) also mentions Surf Canyon in an article about semantic search plug-in [SemantiFind](http://www.semantifind.com).
