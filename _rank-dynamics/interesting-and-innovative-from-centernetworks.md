Following a phone call during his trip out West, Allen Stern at [CenterNetworks](http://www.centernetworks.com/surf-canyon-search-application-mark-cramer) had this to say about Surf Canyon:

> "Compared to some of the other search engine addons I've reviewed in the past, Surf Canyon offers an interesting and innovative model. Surf Canyon is trying to solve the problem of too many search results for your search queries."

Also, Kathy Martyn had a [rant](http://katysrant.blogspot.com/2008/09/firefox-add-ons-i-gotta-try.html) this morning that went like this:

> "Surf Canyon purports to add other engines to the adds functionality and extends search results when you use Google Search... The best part is it also shows results from deeper within the various engines as well, so you don't have to scroll through page after page of results. Surf Canyon puts them right there (where they should be) on page one! Awesome. We'll see how useful that is, **This is a great time saver and one of those, "why didn't they think of this sooner" type things** since usually when the first 20 Google finds are garbage or adverts."

Finally, here's a little feedback from [SeguÃ­laflecha.com](http://www.seguilaflecha.com/news_18727_Surf-Canyon,-profundiza-los-resultados-de-las-busquedas.html), translated for you with the help of Google:

> "Some results can be so effective that you can save a lot of time in terms of seeking to find and bring together the most relevant results with respect to what is being sought."
