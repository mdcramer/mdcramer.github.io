[![The Onion Icon](/assets/images/rank-dynamics/theonion-icon.jpg "The Onion Icon")](http://www.TheOnion.com)Not that search is boring (we think it's incredibly exciting, although we're willing to recognize that perhaps not everyone shares our level of enthusiasm), but why not spice it up with a laugh from time to time?

America's Finest News Source, [The Onion](http://www.TheOnion.com), winner of the prestigious [Peabody Award](http://mediamemo.allthingsd.com/20090401/no-joke-the-onion-wins-one-of-journalisms-biggest-awards/) only last week, has been delighting audiences since 1988. Now, with [Surf Canyon](http://www.surfcanyon.com), you can get their satirical insights during your normal searching on the major search engines. If you already have the application installed, simply go to [my.SurfCanyon.com](http://my.surfcanyon.com) and check the box next to "The Onion."
