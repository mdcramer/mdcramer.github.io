On December 31st we bid farewell to our spacious, wood-floored offices above a silk shop near downtown Oakland for a brand new set of digs at a [co-working facility](http://www.sandboxsuites.com/spacessf1.html) in San Francisco near [10th and Mission](http://www.surfcanyon.com/contact.jsp). The new space is excellent, the people are friendly and we’re excited about the next chapter in our journey.

Additionally, for the month of January, we welcome an intern from MIT: Connie Chan.  She’ll be assisting with development before returning to Boston to continue her junior year of studies in Computer Science.
