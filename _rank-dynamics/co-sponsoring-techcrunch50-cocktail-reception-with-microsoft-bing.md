![TechCrunch50](/assets/images/rank-dynamics/techcrunch50.jpg "TechCrunch50")[Microsoft Bing](http://www.bing.com) has invited [Surf Canyon](http://www.SurfCanyon.com) to co-sponsor, along with [Aardvark](http://www.vark.com) and [Worio](http://www.worio.com), the Celebratory Closing Cocktail Reception at [TechCrunch50](http://www.techcrunch50.com/). From 5:45-7:45pm on Tuesday the 15th, we'll be hosting one of the bars in the main hall at the [San Francisco Design Center Concourse](http://www.sfvenues.com/concourse/directions.html). Our application will be on demonstration and there will be a surf board raffle, so stop by if you're going to be at the event. Look for our banner!

\[Update 9/16/09\] Yesterday was a fabulous event! There were a lot of people and the energy was great. Quite a few individuals stopped by the Surf Canyon-sponsored bar to pick up drinks, grab of few flyers and check out the demo, so we're pleased to have been able to participate. Thanks to Ali @ [Worio](http://www.Worio.com) for looping us in. Also, congratulations to Emmanuel Guisset from [YourTour](http://www.yourtour.com) for winning the surf board raffle!
