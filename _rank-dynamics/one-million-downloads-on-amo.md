We have [thanked Mozilla](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2009/02/19/happy-birthday-to-us/) in the past for the development of their add-on community and their encouragement of and support for add-on developers, but we'd like to take this opportunity to do so again. Thank you!

We've been able to find crucial sites on a variety of topics that we've never been able to find before! Outstanding Add-On. Highly recommended.

### Drill Down Might Be A Better Name

At first glance, or even first try, this add-on may not seem like it's very useful, but with just a little use, one realizes its power. Surf Canyon instantly "drills down" through a search to find potentially relevant results beyond the first page. You can easily and quickly narrow search results to exactly what you're looking for. It's worth trying, and especially worth taking the minute or so to review the "tutorial."

### Brilliant and excellent automated assistant tool for search engines.

One single click to pick up search results from Page 1-100 relevant to the current one. Google tried to improve the relativity between search string and search result by providing user-defined option to each individual link. But google hasn't gone this far. :) Brilliant and excellent automated assistant tool for search engines!!!

This one of the few "5 star" firefox add-ons I've ever seen. I have seen a lot of good firefox extentions of my time, but this one knocks my socks off! Its amazing how I can search something on Google or Yahoo! now and say that the search relevancy was superb!

As a PhD student, this add-on has helped my research tremendously!!! I can find more relevant information with greater efficiency and ease! The developers of this add-on have also been available to help sort out program compatibility issues, and I can't thank them enough for their professionalism and assistance!

### Saves me many hours.

I have been using Firefox for about a year now after a continuum of problems with IE7 and crashes. As I began to add some necessary, and now vital and dependent upon add-ons, I decided to try Surf Canyon as I do a good amount of research in my small business and most is done on the Internet in finding marketing trends, projections and outlooks to incorporate in the business, marketing and strategic plans I write for various small to medium sized businesses. I have come to trust and rely on Surf Canyon as it will quickly go through many pages deep on a search or similar item I want to isolate that almost always leads me to some bit of information I need for satisfying my clients. It is now one of the most used items in my add-on toolbox along with No Script. Thanks for a great and user friendly add-on that reduces many hours of time paging through search results to find something.

### Unique and effective method for searching

The method in which the Search Engine automatically "drills down" by Re-Ranking alternative results (as the developer calls it) within what I would call cascading "sub-lists" for each web page listed as each link is selected is very effective and unique way of obtaining desired results. The user can also optionally continue to "drill down" by clicking on the "target" for each selection to get the same "sub-list". This effective method of "drilling down" your search with cascading levels of "sub-lists" as you make your selections will often cull results that would otherwise typically be many pages down on the search results list. I have found that just two levels of "sub-lists" can very often find results that would have often been 20-30 pages down the list but because of the method of "targeting" results the pertinent web pages will be on the very first page nestled within the cascaded levels of "sub-lists" provided. It is nice to know that when web pages are selected they will open in a new window the way all search engines should but many actually do not unfortunately thus in this case retaining the original search results to more easily return to view other results. I have found the search elapsed time to be very fast and the "target" searches that continue to "drill down" to further detail even faster. To offer a perspective as to how fast, searching the identical thing, I found Surf Canyon each time to be at least twice as fast as Google and as you would expect the manner in which Surf Canyon "drills down" produces more pertinent results in much less time as well. I recommend Surf Canyon with a 5-star rating.
