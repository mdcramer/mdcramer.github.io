![](/assets/images/rank-dynamics/orange-grey-icon.jpg)After nine years operating under the name [Surf Canyon](http://www.surfcanyon.com), we are pleased to announce our new branding. The [real-time contextualization](http://blog.rankdynamics.com/2014/03/07/real-time-contextualized-search/) at the heart of our Dynamic Ranking technology, which has received rave reviews from [users](http://blog.rankdynamics.com/category/testimonials/), the [media](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2009/01/13/googles-searchwiki-surf-canyon-share-the-mossberg-solutions-column/) and the [search community](http://blog.rankdynamics.com/2009/11/10/surf-canyon-surpasses-one-million-queries-a-day/), and has produced [dramatic improvements in relevance over Google](http://blog.rankdynamics.com/2008/12/01/evaluating-surf-canyons-technology-part-2/), will still be at the core of our vision, but the company will now be doing business as [Rank Dynamics](http://www.rankdynamics.com).

The switch coincides with a shift in focus from consumer applications, specifically browser extensions, to enterprise software sales. The old brand [will continue to exist](http://www.surfcanyon.com/extension.jsp) for those individuals interested in adding a significant boost in relevance to their searches on Google, but our attention is now focused on providing a easy way for businesses to enhance their native search. Particularly, we are going to be looking at e-commerce search as here we have [first order evidence](http://rankdynamics.com/contact_us.php) of our ability to enhance revenue.

To all the users and business partners who have enabled us to create, develop and optimize our technology while delivering Dynamic Ranking for almost 7 billion queries, we say, "Thank you." We are excited about this next chapter in our growth.
