![VentureBeat Logo](/assets/images/rank-dynamics/venturebeat-logo.jpg "VentureBeat Logo")As Anthony Ha at [Venture Beat](http://venturebeat.com/2009/10/08/surf-canyon-gets-another-250k-for-its-improved-search-results/) just reported, we have successfully closed an additional $250,000 in funding. We're naturally excited by the vote of confidence from both our existing as well as new investors and would like to thank them for their support.

The good news, however, does not end there. As mentioned in the article, and previously on this blog, our application has been downloaded over [1 million times](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2009/08/25/one-million-downloads-on-amo/) and we are now handling roughly 800,000 queries a day. [Mozilla](http://addons.mozilla.org/) has been tremendously helpful in making our add-on available to Firefox users, which we appreciate greatly.

We're also proud to welcome some exceptional new members to our [Advisory Board](http://www.surfcanyon.com/team.jsp):

- Jonathan Abrams - CEO of [Socializr](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/socializr) and founder of pioneering social network [Friendster](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/friendster).
- Bob Christopher - Former CEO of [Ugobe](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/ugobe) which raised $24 million and developed the [Pleo](http://www.crunchbase.com/product/pleo).
- Dan Martin - Former VP of Business Development at [HomeGain](http://www.homegain.com/).

Finally, the [research paper](http://www.surfcanyon.com/SurfCanyonDemonstrationResearchPaper.pdf) unambiguously demonstrating the extent to which our application enhances relevancy, which we presented at [SIGIR '09](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2009/07/15/selected-for-oral-presentation-at-sigir-09/), will shortly be published by SIGIR and become officially citable.

We're working hard on the next revision to [Surf Canyon](http://www.SurfCanyon.com) and there will be more exciting news to come, so subscribe to [this blog](http://blog.SurfCanyon.com) by entering your email in the upper left-hand corner, become a "fan" on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Surf-Canyon/89720016555) or follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/surfcanyon).
