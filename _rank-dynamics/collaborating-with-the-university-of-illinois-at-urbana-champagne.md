[Tech.com](http://www.tech.com/?p=135), a media property owned and operated by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois and focused on providing news on research and emerging innovations that are developed within universities, research labs and start-up companies throughout the world, today announced that Surf Canyon and the UIUC have “come together to commercialize the concept of real-time implicit personalization.”

We are honored to have the privilege of working with such an esteemed university and are enthusiastic about continuing the collaboration in this exciting area of information retrieval.
