A couple nice screen shots of Surf Canyon in action were included at the bottom. We announced our integration with OneRiot's real-time web results in March with our [launch of v2.0.2](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2009/03/10/v202-real-time-personalization-enhanced-with-real-time-results/) and have since made some esthetic and performance improvements.

Here is OneRiot's [press release](http://www.prweb.com/releases/Realtime_Search_Engine/Social_Web_Search/prweb2455744.htm):

 **WebMynd and Surf Canyon Introduce Realtime Search Powered by OneRiot**

_Browser Add-Ons Customize Google with Results from Realtime Web_

**BOULDER, Colo./ SAN FRANCISCO** – May 22, 2009 - [OneRiot](http://www.OneRiot.com), the realtime web search engine, today announced a partnership with both WebMynd and Surf Canyon to customize Google, Yahoo! and Live Search with realtime web results powered by OneRiot.

WebMynd and Surf Canyon are browser extensions that allow users to personalize traditional search pages.  WebMynd and Surf Canyon are among a growing list of companies to recently join the OneRiot Realtime Search Partner Program which offers developers access to the company’s search API.

[WebMynd](http://www.WebMynd.com) for Firefox helps users visualize their browsing history while also enhancing Google searches with customized results from sources like Wikipedia, YouTube and now OneRiot.  [Surf Canyon](http://www.SurfCanyon.com) for Firefox and Internet Explorer finds relevant information that's buried within pages of search results in Google Yahoo!, MSN Live Search, Lexis Web and Craigslist.

“We are laser focused on improving traditional web search by delivering the most relevant results possible and our partnership with OneRiot is key to that strategy,” said Mark Cramer, CEO of Surf Canyon. “We develop realtime personalization by re-ranking search results ‘on the fly’ and OneRiot’s realtime web results naturally enhance our ability to transform static search pages into dynamic portals of information.”
