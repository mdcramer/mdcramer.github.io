_Destination Search Engine, SearchBar Enhancements, Updated Algorithm and New Website all Lead to Improved User Experience_

**OAKLAND, CALIF.** August 5, 2009 – Surf Canyon, the popular search application that delivers real-time re-ranking to the major search engines, has released v3.0.0, available for download at [www.surfcanyon.com](http://www.surfcanyon.com). Since its release in February 2008, over 1 million people have downloaded the application, which has received rave reviews from users and the media.

The most prominent new offering is a destination search engine, found at [http://search.SurfCanyon.com](http://search.SurfCanyon.com). Not only does this search engine enable real-time re-ranking without requiring client software, but it affords Surf Canyon the ability to personalize the first page of results before they are displayed. Furthermore, it employs an updated algorithm that “diversifies” the result set in order to maximize the benefits from re-ranking.

SearchBar integration with the client software was also enhanced. While entering queries into the SearchBar, users will now be presented with not only query refinements but top search results as well, enabling direct navigation without having to visit the search results page. The IE8 version additionally offers website previews next to the SearchBar results.

“Surf Canyon is the expert on personalizing search in real time,” said Tobias Peggs, General Manager at [OneRiot](http://www.OneRiot.com), a real-time search engine offering the “pulse” of the web. “We’re thrilled to be part of this release, providing Surf Canyon with real-time search results to compliment those found on traditional search engines.”

Blind studies have shown that Surf Canyon’s patents-pending technology increases the relevancy of search results by up to 40%. Mark Cramer, CEO, recently presented these results regarding the efficacy of real-time re-ranking, detailed in a paper entitled “Demonstration of Improved Search Result Relevancy Using Real-Time Implicit Relevance Feedback” ([http://www.surfcanyon.com/SurfCanyonDemonstrationResearchPaper.pdf](http://www.surfcanyon.com/SurfCanyonDemonstrationResearchPaper.pdf)), at SIGIR 2009.

Surf Canyon operates with Google, Yahoo!, Bing and Craigslist. During a standard search, as the user makes selections, Surf Canyon’s algorithm determines what information is being sought and then re-ranks the results “on the fly,” digging out relevant information from as deep as page 100.
