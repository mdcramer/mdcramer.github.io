Surf Canyon is honored to be one of the few companies, and the only private company besides Facebook and Twitter, mentioned in "The future of search" section:

> Importantly, relevant search results are increasingly deemed to be personalized. Autonomous search agents that make suggestions based on personal data, including the user's location, metadata, and more advanced algorithms, are in sight. For example, **Surf Canyon**, a US company, is developing real-time, personalized search capabilities that transform static lists of search results into dynamic pages that rerank results based on a user's real-time online activity.
