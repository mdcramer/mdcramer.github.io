It occurred a couple months ago, but the Editors at [CNET](http://download.cnet.com/Surf-Canyon-for-Firefox/3000-11745_4-10810599.html) have given Surf Canyon a 5-star review:

> "Save time when you surf with this smart add-on that offers further recommendations based on your searches... Basically, this program weeds through of all the useless search results and can save you valuable time. Best of all, there's no charge for this effective and useful Firefox add-on."
