# Dynamic Search
The mission of Rank Dynamics is to transform search into a dynamic experience where fluid result pages respond to user actions in real time. We develop Dynamic Search, a real-time contextual search technology. By transforming static lists of links into dynamic search pages that automatically and immediately re-order results in response to user behavior signals, searchers are able to more quickly and easily find pertinent information that might otherwise have remained buried as deep as page 100.
