Compatibility with [Web of Trust](http://www.mywot.com) (WOT), an extremely popular, free Internet security add-on for your browser, has been in demand for some time. It is thus with pleasure that we can announce that [v2.0.3](http://www.surfcanyon.com/product.jsp) (currently available on [Mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6549)) is fully compatible with the WOT security icons in Firefox.

WOT ratings come from their community of users and are designed to keep you safe from online scams, identity theft, spyware, spam, viruses and unreliable shopping sites by warning you before you interact with a risky website. With the latest version of Surf Canyon, along with the WOT add-on for Firefox, security icons will appear next to all of the search results, including search recommendations and subsequent pages of results.

We'd like to offer a special thanks to the team at WOT for helping us with this solution.

Additionally, the Internet Explorer version of Surf Canyon is now compatible with [IE8](http://www.microsoft.com/ie).

Update (4/6/2009) - WOT has also announced the collaboration on [its blog](http://www.mywot.com/en/blog/142-wot-supports-alternative-smart-search-surfcanyon).
