Gina Trapani at Lifehacker has made Surf Canyon one of its [Featured Downloads](http://lifehacker.com/389390/surf-canyon-browser-extension-deepens-search-results).

[GeekyCoder](http://geekycoder.wordpress.com/2008/05/10/reviewweb-expand-the-web-through-surf-canyon/) has also posted a nice review, including the following:

> "Simple concept with huge potential to be the Next Big Thing... Overall, Surf Canyon deserves to be a indispensable toolkit to any serious web surfer who looking for high quality search merge with better user experience."

Finally, [Pandia Search Engine News](http://www.pandia.com/sew/661-surfcanyon.html) offers some observations:

> Is it any good? Many plug-ins that are supposed to help you do the exact opposite by being a nuisance. SurfCanyon isnâ€™t intrusive... So you can forget all about it until next time you get annoyed at the enormous amount of search results presented by Google and the total absence of any tools for refining your search... With SurfCanyon, you can add a handy tool for improving your search results.
