_Surf Canyon’s browser extension significantly accelerates the search process, enables searchers to find relevant information buried among results_

**OAKLAND, CALIF.** February 19, 2008 – Surf Canyon today announced the official release of its **Discovery Engine for Search™** at [www.SurfCanyon.com](http://www.SurfCanyon.com). The browser extension for Internet Explorer and Firefox, designed to disambiguate user queries in real time, significantly accelerates the search process.

As the volume of content on the internet expands exponentially, so has the challenge of sifting through mountains of search results in order to pinpoint the most relevant. By using Surf Canyon’s semantic real-time implicit personalization technology while searching on Google, Yahoo! or MSN, searchers are able to more quickly and easily find relevant information buried within the usually overwhelming quantity of results. Rather than leaving users to manually filter through static sets of links, this innovative application uses real-time behavior signals to calculate “instantaneous relevancies” within a result set in order to dynamically pull forward the most pertinent results while pushing back those less germane. The technology is similarly suited for targeting sponsored links, benefiting both users and advertisers.

“Like many innovations, the concept was born out of frustration,” said Mark Cramer, Surf Canyon CEO. “While existing search technology is certainly more than adequate for many needs, when looking for something relatively obscure I often felt somewhat alone digging through all the results and, as such, decided that I could benefit from a search technology that would work with me during the process. With our product, search is no longer a static lecture being pushed to the user, but a participatory conversation that yields better and faster results.”

“Surf Canyon significantly improves my search experience and the deeper results it delivers are spot on virtually every time,” said Carla Thompson, senior analyst with The Guidewire Group. “I also really like that it functions within my existing search; once installed, I’m able to enjoy the advantages without having to adjust my habits.”

**About Surf Canyon** Surf Canyon develops real-time implicit personalization technology for internet search.
