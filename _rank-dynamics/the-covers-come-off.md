After 1Â½ years of development, Surf Canyon has emerged from "stealth" mode. Last week a number of online journals, including [CNET](http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9787826-7.html?tag=blog.1), [Mashable](http://mashable.com/2007/09/28/surf-canyon) and [VentureBeat](http://venturebeat.com/2007/09/28/surf-canyon-building-atop-pre-existing-search-engines), published articles about the technology and company. Coverage was picked up in places like [Egypt](http://www.gadgetsarabia.com/2007/10/01/surf-canyon-the-new-search-tool), [Russia](http://www.kaldata.com/comments.php?catid=3&id=26064), [Japan](http://japan.cnet.com/news/media/story/0,2000056023,20357655,00.htm) and [Germany](http://www.zdnet.de/news/tkomm/0,39023151,39158082,00.htm).
