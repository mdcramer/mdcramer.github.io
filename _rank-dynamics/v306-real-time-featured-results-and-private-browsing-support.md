Our last release, [v3.0.5](http://www.surfcanyon.com/product.jsp), was at the end of March, so it's been a while since we put out a new version. We're pleased to announce that [v3.0.6](http://www.surfcanyon.com/product.jsp) went out on June 30th and contains real-time featured results as well as support for Firefox's private browsing mode.
