Joel Evans, Chief Geek of [Geek.com](http://www.geek.com/feature-search-your-search-results-with-surf-canyon/), today made Surf Canyon a "Geek Pick" and had this to say:

> "This is a must-have plug-in... I tend to use Google for the majority of my searching, and this tool breathed new life into the experience."

Ernst-Jan Pfauth, Editor and Chief of [The Next Web](http://thenextweb.org/2008/03/17/france-loves-search-personalization-service-surf-canyon/), and not necessarily a geek, had this to say yesterday in his article entitled "France loves search personalization service Surf Canyon":

> "Apart from itâ€™s new approach on search personalization, I also like the international mindset of Cramer and his team. Most US-based start-ups just focus on the huge home market, yet Surf Canyon works in 13 different languages."
