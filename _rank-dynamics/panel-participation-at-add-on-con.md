Once again, [Mike Wertheim](http://www.surfcanyon.com/team.jsp), our Chief Architect, participated in a panel discussion at the 2009 [Add-on-Con](http://addoncon.com) on December 11th at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View. Like [last year's topic](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2008/12/06/panel-participatation-at-add-on-con/), this one was related to cross-browser development. For everyone who missed it, you can watch the video either below or on the Add-on-Con [blog](http://addoncon.com/blog/?p=116).
