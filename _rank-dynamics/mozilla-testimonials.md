Since Surf Canyon was introduced to [Mozilla's download page](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2008/05/04/extention-approved-by-mozilla/) back in May we have received a number of [user reviews](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/reviews/display/6549?show=100). Here is a sampling of some of the best ones:

### Surf Canyon finds links Google misses

[![5 stars](/assets/images/rank-dynamics/stars.png)](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/stars.png "Rated 5 out of 5 stars")by [Bob S](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/2724287) on October 17, 2008

There are a batch of Google "enhancers" and they work somewhat-- but if you're researching projects, data, etc. Surf Canyon goes a step further. I had been researching something and was frustrated by the search engines out there. Time after time I got the same results until I weeks later I discovered Surf Canyon. I didn't expect much, but was surprised. I had the same search criteria and found things that were "skipped" before. I highly recommend it.

### Amazing time saver

this plugin is the best thing to happen to search since google, since it filters and helps dig things pages down that might be relevant. this is motly for those users that don't like going down to page two and beyond in the results.

I've been using Surf Canyon for months now. It saves a lot of search time and cuts through extraneous matches. It works seamlessly with Google, enhancing queie success. Higly recommend that you use this.

### Works in FF3

[![5 stars](/assets/images/rank-dynamics/stars.png)](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/stars.png "Rated 5 out of 5 stars")by [Harvey108](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/118484) on August 13, 2008

I tried Surf Canyon in FF3 with Yahoo and Google search pages and they both work well. I may report back after several weeks of use with more details. At first I could not use the Surf Canyon Assistant but then I found, with the assistance of Surf Canyon developers, that my admuncher was blocking the program. We had to put it on a white list in admuncher and now the Surf Canyon works in Google.

### Fantastic Add-On

Excellent search tool - finds more relevent results. Ideal for research or people who use the search engines a lot. Highly recommended.

### Very Useful

[![5 stars](/assets/images/rank-dynamics/stars.png)](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/stars.png "Rated 5 out of 5 stars")by [pm55](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/2009909) on July 30, 2008

My first impressions on using this is that it is a "first class" add-on. It is worth trying if you do much searching. Thank you so very much for creating it!

Definitely improves Google results. Extremely useful - couldn't live without it anymore - and I am making this statement after using it for only one week!

### Great search tool!

Surf Canyon is an excellent addition to search. I find the relevance of it's results extremely helpful. In a search world where results on the first page are crucial, this is also beneficial to companies whose results are on lower pages. Nice work, Surf Canyon!

Great add-on, great support, too!

### Running SC in an academic setting

I've just recently discovered Surf Canyon and I have already come to appreciate its value as an aid when using the web for my research and curriculum projects at Portland State University. I will be recommending it to my colleagues and students.

### Complemento ideal para Google

[![5 stars](/assets/images/rank-dynamics/stars.png)](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/stars.png "Rated 5 out of 5 stars")by [Iván Lasso](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/1174747) on June 17, 2008

Sin duda, esta extensión es excelente para complementar cualquier tipo de búsqueda en Google, pero sobre todo aquellas especialmente intrincadas. Si ya ponerse a navegar "al tun tun" podría hacer que te embarques en un viaje de horas, Surf Canyon podría extenderlo hasta en días, ayudándote a descubrir cosas interesantes a partir de los enlaces que habrás. Son extensiones como éstas las que consiguen que Firefox sea el mejor navegador de hoy en día. Completamente imprescindible.

\[Google's translation: Without doubt, this extension is an excellent complement to any search on Google, but especially those especially intricate. If you already navigate "to tun tun" might make you embark on a journey of hours, Surf Canyon could extend up in days, helping you to discover interesting things from the links you may have. They are extensions as they get to the Firefox browser is the best today. Absolutely indispensable.\]

Surf Canyon is non-invasive, doesn't slow anything down, and you won't notice it's there until you need it. Excellent tool.

[![5 stars](/assets/images/rank-dynamics/stars.png)](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/stars.png "Rated 5 out of 5 stars")by [Mohammed-Alzubi](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/1632713) on June 7, 2008

Exactly what i'm looking for, I just did a search on Google and the piece of information I needed was on Page 6 !!!, I don’t think I’ve ever made it to page 6. Thanks Surf Canyon for a great tool.

### Surf Canyon offers new way of search and browsing the web

[![5 stars](/assets/images/rank-dynamics/stars.png)](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/stars.png "Rated 5 out of 5 stars")by [geekycoder geekycoder](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/1360249) on May 14, 2008

After installing this plug-in, I find that it offers a great way to explore search result without going from page to page. Everything is done within the same page, and you might just find some interesting related search link when you explore on the search result further. Yes, Surf Canyon generate its own set of high quality search result to complement those of the search engine.

No user interface is perfect but this truly offers a convenient and innovative ways of viewing results without replacing the powerful search engine we love.
