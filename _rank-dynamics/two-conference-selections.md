Surf Canyon was recently selected to present at two prestigious conferences.

The first is the [Fourth Annual Piper Jaffray Global Internet Summit](www.piperjaffray.com/gis2008) to be held at the Montage Resort & Spa in Laguna Beach on November 11th and 12th. Mark Cramer will be speaking on the "Searching for the Future" panel with [Hakia](http://www.Hakia.com), to be moderated by Gene Munster, Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst at Piper Jaffray, who [previously](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2008/05/28/seed-funding-secured/) had this to say about Surf Canyon:

> “After having spent time analyzing Surf Canyon’s product, we believe that, because of its ability to quickly and easily enable users to locate relevant information that might otherwise have been impossible to find, real-time personalization represents a significant next step in the evolution of search.”
