Back in November we updated you on [some of the feedback](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2008/11/10/mozilla-testimonials/) we've been receiving on [AMO (addons.mozilla.org)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6549). Since then there's been a lot of [more positive stuff](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/reviews/display/6549?show=100). Here are some of the highlights:

This is like adding adrenaline to google search. Based upon your searching, it locates extra links that you will probably find useful. You can also add the latest twitter comments based upon your search terms.

### Love it!

As a researcher I love Surf Canyon! I am able to drill down into my searches much faster.....Thanks for the add-on!

Now that Surf Canyon works with WOT on every search, it's perfect! Thanks Surf Canyon for listening to your users.

Awesome idea! Excellent implementation so far, and still room to make this into an even more valuable add-on. Something "G" has failed to implement themselves. Everybody is different - so how could returning the exact same results to a gazillion people be optimal? (trick question)\*Definitely\* worth checking out, IMHO!

I'm not one to use a lot or even try 'non-appearance' add-ons ... but, with all these good reviews I thought I'd try it out, and I was surprised how RIDICULOUSLY accurate it was. No doubt, 5 stars - great tool. (Firefox keeps getting better and better.)

What a great research tool...This addon digs deep through the SERPs to bring me pages that I would never find without it - great for me and great for the pages that would otherwise remain buried! Had a little trouble with it in the beginning, through no fault of the addon. Am just as impressed with support. Slick!
