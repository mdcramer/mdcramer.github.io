Today we released the [latest version](http://www.surfcanyon.com/search/versions.jsp) of our [application](http://www.surfcanyon.com/).

The big, new feature, which some of you might already have seen recently, is "Categories". While similar to [clustering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_clustering), these Categories are based on real-time actions and will help you to "drill down" on your search through a better understanding of your "at the moment" intent.

Additionally, the update includes other minor fixes and enhancements, including correcting an issue with some types of Google links.

Update (10/23/08) - [Jean-Marie Gall](http://www.jeanmariegall.com/2008/10/23/surf-canyon-disponibilit-de-la-nouvelle-version-1101-mj/), one of our fans from France, returned to spread the word of the recent release. We've taken the liberty of translating his feedback in the comments:

> "From the moment Surf Canyon was installed on my laptop, always happy, never any worries, I could not do without it given how much I'm used to it for my research..."

Christophe Deschamps at [Outils Froids](http://www.outilsfroids.net/news/inquisitor-accelere-vos-recherches-d-informations-mais-surfcanyon-fait-encore-mieux) had this to say while announcing both the new version of Inquisitor and Surf Canyon:

> "Inquisitor accelerates your informational researches (but Surf Canyon does it even better)"
