It wasn't too long ago that we pushed out [v2.0.1](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2009/02/18/v201-the-lexisweb-edition/), but [v2.0.2](http://www.surfcanyon.com/versions.jsp) could not wait. Perhaps that's because it has to do with real-time information for your searches on the major search engines.

Back in December, [ReadWriteWeb](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/discovering_power_of_twitter_search.php) start talking about how Twitter, a very popular micro-blogging service, could deliver search results "in real time." Search engines typically have to index a page before it can be searched, which requires time. Searching Twitter, however, enables access to real-time information as there is no built in latency. As soon as someone Tweets it, you can search it.

[OneRiot](http://www.oneriot.com), a new social search engine that find the "pulse" of the web, also delivers real-time information. They keep a running record of the contents of the Internet, however, unlike other search engines, they prioritize that information based on its current (i.e. real-time) popularity. That makes OneRiot's search results, as they say, "relevant, fresh, friendly and pulsing with the real-time energy of the web."

Now with Surf Canyon you can have all these real-time results inserted directly onto the search pages of your favorite search engines. Go to [my.SurfCanyon.com](http://my.surfcanyon.com) and check the boxes for Twitter and OneRiot. The next time you search on Google, Yahoo! or Microsoft Live, should real-time results be available and relevant then they'll automatically be inserted onto the page.
