Scott Blitstein at [Web Worker Daily](http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/09/23/surf-canyon-digs-deep-for-relevant-results/) gives a very nice review of Surf Canyon. In particular, he had this to say:

> "I guess the way I know that Surf Canyon is useful to me is that I notice the lack of the bullseye on machines where it isn’t installed. I don’t realize how much I use it, but in a short period of time it has become a part of my search process and I find I miss the functionality it brings when it isn’t available."
