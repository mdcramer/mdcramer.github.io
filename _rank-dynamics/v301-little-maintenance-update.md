While there are no fancy new features or enhancement to announce this time, this [latest version](http://www.surfcanyon.com/product.jsp) was released to handle compatibility with some changes on Google's search page. If you're using [Bing](http://www.Bing.com) or [Yahoo!](http://search.yahoo.com/) then you don't need this one, but we'd recommend that you grab it anyway.

With this release, we're suggesting that our Firefox users check out an exciting add-on called [Interclue](http://interclue.com/). Ever wanted to know what was behind the link before you clicked? Interclue tells you everything you need to know before you open yet another tab. Small icons appear on mouseover to warn you about dead links, Malware and Phishing Sites. For valid links, Interclue provides a compact preview as well as optional extra information and next action buttons. We hope that you enjoy it!
