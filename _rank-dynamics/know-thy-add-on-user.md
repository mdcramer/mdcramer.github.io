Mark Cramer, CEO of Surf Canyon, offers some thoughts on the [Mozilla blog](http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2009/01/20/know-thy-add-on-user/) regarding gathering and responding to user feedback. We have done our best to collect as much as information as possible from our users, as well as anyone else who wishes to offer feedback, and will continue to strive to respond, to the best of our ability, to the inquiries and suggestions of everyone who [contacts us](http://www.surfcanyon.com/search/contact.jsp).
