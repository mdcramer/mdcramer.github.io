**400,000 People Find Just What They Are Looking For With Surf Canyon**

 _Smart Real-time Personalization Technology Accelerates Web Search_

**OAKLAND, CALIF.** October 21, 2008 – Since its release in February, over 400,000 people seeking more precise search results have downloaded Surf Canyon’s free application at [www.SurfCanyon.com](http://www.surfcanyon.com). Using technology to determine the searcher’s “at the moment” intent, the technology continually refines relevancies and rankings in response to user actions. It’s similar to a virtual assistant that instantly sorts through slews of generalized results to find the proverbial needle in a haystack. As such, more than 20 million queries were handled in the last quarter.

“400,000 downloads is only just the beginning, but we’re very pleased with the early rate of adoption as well as the efficacy of the application and user retention,” said Mark Cramer, CEO of Surf Canyon. “This was by no means an easy technology to develop, so after 2½ years of hard work it’s incredibly gratifying to see how well it is doing.”

Surf Canyon works with the major search engines -- Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft Live Search -- and Craigslist. Users don’t need to fire up a separate application or window to use Surf Canyon as the technology integrates into the browser. Real-time personalized results are then displayed underneath the standard search results right on the web page being viewed.

The technology has been popular with universities. “I’ve been using Surf Canyon for the past four months and have become so addicted to the re-ranking functionality that it bothers me whenever I’m on a machine that doesn’t have it installed,” said Michael Flower, Professor of Interdisciplinary Science Studies at Portland State University. “The value of this application for web-assisted research is so important that I’ve begun recommending it to all of my students.”

Surf Canyon has been a Featured Download at popular technology review site Lifehacker.com, is currently on Mozilla.org’s list of “Recommended Add-Ons,” for Firefox (an honor bestowed on a mere 1½% of the 2500+ available add-ons) and is recognized by DEMO.com as an “Innovator to Watch.” Surf Canyon has also been recommended as a research tool in ComputerWorld’s short list of “School 2.0” essentials and has received glowing reviews across the web.
