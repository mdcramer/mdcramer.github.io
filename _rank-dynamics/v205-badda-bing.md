The big news with [v2.0.5](http://www.surfcanyon.com/product.jsp), released this morning, is integration with Microsoft's shiny new search engine, [Bing](http://www.bing.com)! Only launched on Monday of this week, Bing is very impressive and has been receiving [wonderful reviews](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/01/apparently-bing-is-something-of-a-hit/). Now, only a few days later, thanks to the latest version of Surf Canyon's [glowingly-reviewed](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2009/01/13/googles-searchwiki-surf-canyon-share-the-mossberg-solutions-column/), [award-winning](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2008/12/19/top-10-ases-for-2008/) [application](http://www.SurfCanyon.com), it's even better:

- [Real-time personalization](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2008/12/01/evaluating-surf-canyon%E2%80%99s-technology-part-2/) - Easily find relevant information _buried_ in Bing's results with real-time re-ranking.
- [Real-time results](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2009/05/22/oneriot-announces-real-time-search-partnership-with-surf-canyon/) - Insert relevant real-time results from [OneRiot](http://blog.oneriot.com/content/2009/06/oneriot-partners-plugs-bing-in-to-realtime/) and Twitter.
- [Query refinements](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2009/04/30/v204-further-refinements/) - Search reformulations are suggested based on your "at the moment" information need.
- [Customize content](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2008/12/09/v200-welcome-to-mysurfcanyoncom/) - Use [my.SurfCanyon.com](http://my.SurfCanyon.com) to indicate the sources of information you prefer, as well as those you'd like to avoid.

Don Dodge, Director of Business Development for Microsoft's Emerging Business Team and author of [The Next Big Thing](http://dondodge.typepad.com/the_next_big_thing/2009/06/bing-gets-real-time-search-with-oneriot.html), wrote about Surf Canyon's integration with Bing:

> Two... innovative startups, [WebMynd](http://www.webmynd.com) and [Surf Canyon](http://www.surfcanyon.com), worked quickly to customize Bing with real-time search results powered by [OneRiot](http://www.oneriot.com). Surf Canyon CEO, Mark Cramer, said that they are excited about this integration because “Bing users can now re-rank search results ‘on the fly’ plus get OneRiot’s real-time web results to further transform Bing search results into dynamic portals of information."

Additionally, the new version contains additional compatibility with Google's search pages.

Finally, we'd like to suggest that our users give [WOT (Web of Trust)](http://www.mywot.com) a try. WOT warns you about risky websites that try to scam visitors, deliver malware, send spam or steal personal information. WOT's color-coded icons show you ratings for over 22 million websites - green for trust, yellow for caution and red to stop - helping you avoid interaction with harmful sites. We ensured full [compatibility with WOT](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2009/03/27/v203-just-wot-you-need/) in v2.0.3.

Enjoy! And, as always, we appreciate [feedback](http://www.surfcanyon.com/contact.jsp).
