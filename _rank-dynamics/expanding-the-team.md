![](/assets/images/rank-dynamics/Brandon.png "Brandon")This week [Brandon McMullin](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/brandon-mcmullin/3/1b0/9b6) started work at Surf Canyon as a Software Engineer. He will focus primarily on the development of our new social search application, [Chummo](http://www.chummo.com).

In addition to his passion for software engineering, Brandon studies [Shorinji Kempo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorinji_Kempo), an art that focuses on personal improvement and the balance between strength and compassion. He is also a father. His 13-month-old daughter just recently gained some proficiency in walking and is intensely interested in exploring the world around her. She's also very interested in daddy's toys (like the laptop and Xbox controller) and has begun building structures with [Mega Bloks](http://www.megabloks.com/). Clearly an engineer already in the making!

Our first hire in a few years, we're thrilled to welcome Brandon to the team!
