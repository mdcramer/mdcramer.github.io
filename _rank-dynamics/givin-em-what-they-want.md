Kaila Colbin, who blogs for [VortexDNA](http://blog.vortexdna.com), had some very flattering comments in a MediaPost [Search Insider](http://blogs.mediapost.com/search_insider/?p=820) article entitled "Speculating in (Online) Real Estate":

> "I love this idea \[Surf Canyon\] for a few reasons. It fits neatly into what the user is already doing at the time: no upskilling or behavioral change necessary. It integrates beautifully with the existing real estate. It offers something of genuine value to the consumer.
> 
> I donâ€™t know if Surf Canyon is making any money off its plug-in, but its approach exemplifies what made Google so successful: delivering _what_ people want, _when_ and _how_ they want it."
