The latest version of Surf Canyon ([v3.0.2](http://www.surfcanyon.com/product.jsp)) went out yesterday, so many of you have already received the auto-update. The important new feature is "sharing." In collaboration with [Shareaholic](http://www.Shareaholic.com), Surf Canyon now enables users to share virtually any webpage on the internet. By clicking the envelope button in the URL bar at the top of the Firefox browser (this feature is not yet available for Internet Explorer), users can send the webpage currently being viewed to friends and colleagues via email, Gmail, [Facebook](http://www.Facebook.com) and [Twitter](http://www.Twitter.com).

Should you be interested in more sharing options, from over 60 different services, we'd like to invite you to download the full version of [Shareaholic](http://www.Shareaholic.com). Shareaholic is an award-winning add-on that has been downloaded over 1 million times by people looking for a customizable, light-weight method of sharing web pages.

Additionally, we've expanded the [Craigslist image preview](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2008/06/12/v110-the-craigslist-edition/) functionality to enable full-sized previews upon mouse-over.

\[Update 11/13/09\] [v3.0.3](http://www.surfcanyon.com/product.jsp) was released a couple days after v3.0.2 to fix a couple issues that snuck through.
