Surf Canyon is proud to be a sponsor of the Fifth Annual International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining ([WSDM 2012](http://www.wsdm2012.org/)). After having our research selected for oral presentation at [SIGIR '09](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2009/07/15/selected-for-oral-presentation-at-sigir-09/) in Boston and then having attended other academic conferences, we have a strong appreciation for the effort and dedication required to produce high-quality research in the very challenging field of search. While we didn't have a paper to submit this time, we will naturally be attending the conference and look forward to the presentations as well as connecting, and reconnecting, with talented researches from around the world.
