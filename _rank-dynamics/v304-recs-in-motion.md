Yesterday we released the [latest version](http://www.surfcanyon.com/product.jsp) of Surf Canyon's client application. One of the most important enhancements you won't even be able to "see," but we've adjusted some of our processes to enhance the speed with which the application operates. Your Recommendations should now come faster than ever.

The change that you will be able to "see" is an aesthetic enhancement designed to help visually communicate the functionality of the application. Now when recommendations are inserted into the search results, they quickly come shooting up from the bottom of the page. This should make sense since all of the Recommendations come from further down in the result set. Using real-time search personalization, Surf Canyon helps people find relevant results that might otherwise have remained buried on pages 2 through 100 by pulling them up to the current page.
