Surf Canyon recently received some positive coverage in the Hexagon, with nice reviews at [Outils Froids](http://www.outilsfroids.net/news/surf-canyon-un-service-qui-affine-vos-recherches-en-temps-reel) and [Journalistiques](http://www.journalistiques.fr/post/2007/11/21/Surf-Canyon-aiguise-la-curiosite-et-approfondit-la-recherche). While both are in French, we have taken the liberty of translating a sentence from the conclusion of M. Deschamps' article:

> "For two days I have tested \[Surf Canyon\] with all my searches as opposed to using Google and I must recognize that I am particularly carried away by the quality of the results supplied as well as the speed with which one discovers that which one seeks."

Update (12/11/07): Another online journal in France, [Street Reporters](http://www.streetreporters.net/views/537-surf-canyon), has posted a nice article.
