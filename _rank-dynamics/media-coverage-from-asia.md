[Lifehacker Japan](http://www.lifehacker.jp/2008/10/post_294.html) recently wrote about Surf Canyon. While the technology wasn't explicitly developed for Japanese, it does work in many different languages, so it's great to see that it's delivering value. Here are some translated bits:

> "Surf Canyon... adds a new dimension to the search results... If the results include something close to what you're looking for, digging it gives you a feeling of pulling the information closer to you... While it sometimes gives recommendations that are off the mark, it can give you exactly what you wanted without going through pages of search results."

A couple of sites in China have also given us reviews. [Weborn.org](http://www.weborn.org/surf-canyon-624/), according to a computer translation, had this to say:

> "Surf Canyon personalizes your search results making them more intelligent."

> Â "Surf Canyon lets you search smarter."

Here's a screen shot from the Rainy-bow website of Surf Canyon working in Chinese:
