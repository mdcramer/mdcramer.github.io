[Stefan Hammon](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/stefan-hammond/b/489/903), writing an article for [Computerworld](http://news.idg.no/cw/art.cfm?id=51E659AD-DD59-A751-D66280576591D787) about Google's new privacy policy, had this to say:

We would point out that, for many queries, the innovative [Dynamic Ranked Retrieval](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2012/01/18/cornell-university-produces-more-research-on-dynamic-ranked-retrieval/) technology that we developed and embedded into our search page significantly [_improves_ the search experience](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2008/12/01/evaluating-surf-canyons-technology-part-2/ "Evaluating Surf Canyonâ€™s Technology") over Google by automatically digging out relevant results for the user, but we are flattered nonetheless.
