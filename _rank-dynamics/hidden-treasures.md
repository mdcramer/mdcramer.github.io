It has been observed for some time that search engine users rarely venture past the first page of results. Various studies have shown that only 10% of the time does a user click on a result with a rank greater than 10. A typical user would thus rather reformulate the query or abandon the search when they can't find what they need on page one.

This is particularly problematic since, as discussed [previously](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2007/09/19/hold-the-pickles-hold-the-lettuce/), it’s increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to map two- and three-word queries to the exploding content on the internet. It is thus [increasing unlikely](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2008/01/16/maybe-if-i-just-add-some-quotes%e2%80%a6/) that the top 10 will contain the information sought without some form of [additional input](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2008/02/05/dont-ask-just-do-it/) from the user, either explicitly (reformulation suggestions or clusters) or implicitly (personalization).

But what if there was a search technology that was able to dig into the results and fetch the relevant information for you?

Surf Canyon's Discovery for Search™ technology is designed to find the “hidden treasures” in the subsequent search results, and Beta testing has confirmed this. The graph below compares the initial rank of a result (x-axis) with the frequency with which it is clicked (y-axis). The AOL data is from 2006 and the Surf Canyon data is from the most recent 10,000 queries. The result is that Surf Canyon doubles (17% vs. 9%) the users’ ability to find relevant information buried in the search results.
