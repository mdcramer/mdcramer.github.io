We made our application [compatible with IE8](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2009/03/27/v203-just-wot-you-need/) back in March with the v2.0.3 release, and then [enhanced the IE8](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2009/07/30/v300-not-only-the-journey-but-the-destination/) functionality in July with the v3.0.0 release by taking advantage of some specific IE8 features. In particular, we included image previews, along with the top 3 search results, directly in the SearchBar drop-down.

The [official twitter page for Internet Explorer](http://twitter.com/IE) recognized our work this morning with the following [tweet](http://twitter.com/IE/status/4343514245), which links to our add-on in the [Internet Explorer Add-ons Gallery](http://www.ieaddons.com/en/details/searchhelpers/Surf_Canyon/):

Also in the IE Gallery you can find our [Instant Visual Search](http://www.ieaddons.com/en/details/searchhelpers/Instant_Visual_Search_Surf_Canyon/) plug-in, which offers just the SearchBar integration, as well as the [Search Assistant by OneRiot](http://www.ieaddons.com/en/details/searchhelpers/Search_Assistant_by_OneRiot/). Together with [OneRiot](http://www.OneRiot.com), the real-time search engine company with whom we've [worked in the past](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2009/05/22/oneriot-announces-real-time-search-partnership-with-surf-canyon/), we've developed a OneRiot-customized version of the IE add-on for those users who wants to make sure to get real-time results when they're searching on Bing, Google or Yahoo!:
