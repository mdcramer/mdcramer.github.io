Surf Canyon recently had the opportunity to demonstrate its product at a couple of forums in San Francisco. The first was at the March Geek Out on the 12th hosted by [SF New Tech](http://sfnewtech.com/2008/03/04/sf-new-tech-geek-out-demos-mighty-630-pm-on-312/). The audience seemed to think we did a [pretty good job](https://sfnt.wufoo.com/reports/ratings-for-31208-/). The second was at [SF Beta](http://www.sfbeta.com/) on April 1st. Rebecca Reeve at [bub.blicio.us](http://bub.blicio.us/?p=835) has some nice coverage:

> "Their simple, easy-to-understand product returns better search results ... based on your actions."
