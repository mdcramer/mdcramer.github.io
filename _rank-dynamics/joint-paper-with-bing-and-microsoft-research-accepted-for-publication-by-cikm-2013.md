![CIKM 2013](/assets/images/rank-dynamics/cikm-2013-logo.jpg)The 2013 ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management ([CIKM](http://cikm2013.org/ "ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management")) is [one of the major forums](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIKM "Wikipedia - Conference on Information and Knowledge Management") for research on database management, information retrieval, and knowledge management. As such, we are proud to announce that our latest research paper, entitled "**[Understanding How People Interact with Web Search Results that Change in Real-Time Using Implicit Feedback](http://www.surfcanyon.com/UnderstandingWebSearchInteractionsPaper.pdf)**," co-authored with [Jin Young Kim](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~jykim/ "Jin Young Kim") from Bing, [Jaime Teevan](http://research.microsoft.com/~teevan "Jaime Teevan") from Microsoft Research and [Dmitry Lagun](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~dlagun/ "Dmitry Lagun") from Emory University, has been accepted by the conference. Only 106 papers out of 848 submissions were selected, so the conference was very competitive.

The data [once again](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2008/12/01/evaluating-surf-canyons-technology-part-2/ "Evaluating Surf Canyon’s Technology") demonstrates the extent to which dynamically ranking search results in response to real-time user feedback dramatically improves relevance:

> Compared to traditional web search, users presented with dynamically ranked results exhibit higher engagement and find information faster, particularly during exploratory tasks. These findings have implications for how search engines might best exploit implicit feedback in real-time in order to help users identify the most relevant results as quickly as possible.

Enjoy the paper and if you attend the CIKM 2013 conference in San Francisco we look forward to seeing you there.

\[Update - 2013-8-15\] The [paper](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/teevan/publications/papers/cikm13.pdf "Understanding How People Interact with Web Search Results that Change in Real-Time Using Implicit Feedback") may also be found on [Jaime Teevan](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/teevan/publications/ "Jaime Teevan - Microsoft Research")’s website at Microsoft Research.

\[Update - 2013-9-9\] We will be presenting during the [Short Paper Session 52 - IR Track](http://www.cikm2013.org/schedule.php "CIKM 2013 Schedule") with is from 4-6:15pm on Thursday, October 31st.
