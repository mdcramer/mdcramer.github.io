This handy feature has been around for a few weeks, but it's worth pointing out now. Ever wish there was an easy way to email results you find directly off search results page? Wish no more!

Next to every search result Surf Canyon has added an "Email This" link (indicated by the red circles below) that, when clicked, will open up your email client and load up the result for easy delivery. Simply enter the email addresses of whoever you like and press "Send."

_Important Note:_ Surf Canyon does not collect email addresses and will never spam. We loathe spam. As a matter of fact, unless you put Surf Canyon on copy, we can't even know your email address, the addresses of the recipients or even that you sent the email.
