This paper, entitled "[Personalizing Web Search using Long Term Browsing History](http://www.academia.edu/735799/Personalizing_Web_Search_using_Long_Term_Browsing_History "Personalizing Web Search using Long Term Browsing History")," was submitted to WSDM in 2011, but only recently came to our attention. The authors, Nicolaas Matthijs from the University of Cambridge and Filip Radlinski from Microsoft, write about "a user interest profile using usersâ€™ complete browsing behavior," but we thank them for taking a moment to recognize Surf Canyon's contribution to the field:

> Recently, personalized search has also been made available in some mainstream web search engines including Google and Yahoo!. These appear to use a combination of explicitly and implicitly collected information about the user. Many more companies are engaging in personalization both for search (e.g. [surfcanyon.com](http://www.surfcanyon.com "Surf Canyon")) and for advertising based on user behavior.
