About&#46;com has posted the winners of their 2010 Reader's Choice Awards and we're thrilled to announce that Surf Canyon won in the category of [Best Search Engine](https://web.archive.org/web/20100306020705/http://websearch.about.com/od/2010readerschoiceawards/ss/2010-readers-choice-awards-winners_10.htm). In their own words,

> "The race for the Best Search Engine was intriguing, with a relatively unknown newcomer, [Surf Canyon](http://www.surfcanyon.com/), picking up 48% of the votes and beating out search engine powerhouses Google, Yahoo! and Bing."

Charles Knight at [The Next Web Search](http://thenextweb.com/search/2010/03/04/discovery-engine-year-surf-canyon/) covered the story and had this to say:

> "Surf Canyon is Google on steroids (but it also works on Yahoo!, Bing, and Craigslist). It turbo charges your web searches."

We would like to thank our fans who voted for Surf Canyon as well as all of the users and partners who have helped to make our search engine what it is today.

\[Update 3/5/10\] It's wonderful when we get coverage from [all over the globe](/rank-dynamics/all-corners-of-globe/).
