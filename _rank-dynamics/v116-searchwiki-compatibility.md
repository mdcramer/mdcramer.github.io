Yesterday Google began its roll-out of [SearchWiki](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/11/searchwiki-make-search-your-own.html) and Surf Canyon's [v1.1.6](http://www.surfcanyon.com/search/versions.jsp) was only a few hours behind.

When logged into Google, SearchWiki enables users to personalize their individual search pages by "promoting" results to the topÂ  and "removing" results from the page by clicking icons. The latest version of our real-time implicit personalization application is now compatible with the explicit user customization offered by SearchWiki. Results that are "promoted" take their nested recommendations with them, as do results that are "removed."

> "very handy results mining Firefox extension."
