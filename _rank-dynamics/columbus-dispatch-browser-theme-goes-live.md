While [Surf Canyon](http://www.SurfCanyon.com) personalizes the search results so that content from The Columbus Dispatch is given priority, Brand Thunder customizes the entire browser experience. In addition to visually enhancing the browser with shots of the Columbus skyline or [The 'Shoe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shoe), users will now be able to effortlessly access Dispatch news and content through links in the top of the browser as well as a side bar that may be opened and closed.

Together the two applications offer readers of The Columbus Dispatch unprecedented control over the information coming through the browser as well as being delivered by the major search engines.

Here is Brand Thunder's [press release](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2009/08/prweb2772034.htm):

The Boom! offers two distinct looks: one with a view of the Columbus skyline and the other with a look into the ‘Shoe, Ohio State University’s football stadium.
