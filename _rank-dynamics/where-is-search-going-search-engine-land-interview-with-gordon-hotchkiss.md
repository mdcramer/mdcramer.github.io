One of the most respected voices in understanding search user behavior, [Gordon Hotchkiss](http://searchengineland.com/author/gord-hotchkiss/) is the CEO of [Enquiro](http://www.enquiro.com/) and a popular keynote speaker at search industry events. His ongoing series on [Search Engine Land](http://searchengineland.com) regarding the future of search has so far included conversations with Bing's [Stefan Weitz](http://searchengineland.com/bings-stefan-weitz-rethinking-the-search-experience-34165), author and CEO of Federated Media [John Battelle](http://searchengineland.com/john-battelle-on-the-future-of-search-38382) and Google's [Johanna Wright](http://searchengineland.com/where-is-search-going-googles-johanna-wright-45983). The latest installment in the "**[Where Is Search Going?](http://searchengineland.com/where-is-search-going-surf-canyons-mark-cramer-48224)**" series is an interview with Mark Cramer, CEO of [Surf Canyon](http://www.surfcanyon.com/).

Gordon had some very flattering things to say. After referring to one of the experiments outlined in our [research paper](/assets/papers/SurfCanyonDemonstrationResearchPaper.pdf), which was recently published by [SIGIR](/rank-dynamics/selected-for-oral-presentation-at-sigir-09/), he replied, "A 40% uptick in user satisfaction by any measure is pretty impressive." Later, after describing a little about the algorithm behind the re-ranking he responded, "That was impressive. An algorithm that recognizes the subtlety of subcontext has some decent IP cred behind it." He concluded with:

> “... I installed Surf Canyon and was fairly impressed. It was more helpful than I expected (though there may be few more skeptical critics of search user experiences than me)... If you’re not a search marketer \[who often needs to see the “vanilla” version of the SERP\], I’d definitely recommend taking it for a spin.”

Gordon's next post in the series will be Part II of the conversation with Mark Cramer in which they will "speculate on where search might go in the future."

\[Update 10/1/2010\] - Search Engine Land has published the [second part of the interview](/rank-dynamics/search-as-a-conversation-second-part-of-search-engine-land-interview-with-gordon-hotchkiss/).
