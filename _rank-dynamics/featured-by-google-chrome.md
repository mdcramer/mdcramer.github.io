Back in June of 2008 [Surf Canyon](http://www.SurfCanyon.com)'s [browser extension](http://www.surfcanyon.com/extension.jsp) was first listed by Mozilla as a "[recommended](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2008/06/04/mozilla-recommends-surf-canyon/)" add-on. Yesterday we received similar treatment from the folks at Google Chrome who have added **[Surf Canyon](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ennflnaebogjainllkhndcpafcgechbb)** to their list of "[featured](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/list/featured)" extensions. We are thrilled and honored by the recognition!
