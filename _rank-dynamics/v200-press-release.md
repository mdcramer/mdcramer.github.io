**Personalized Internet Search Gets Smarter**

_Surf Canyon Version 2.0 Released_

**OAKLAND, CALIF.** December 9, 2008 – Today Surf Canyon released version 2.0 of its popular search enhancement application, which uses patents-pending technology to transform the standard, static search engine page into a collection of targeted results that dynamically respond to users’ actions in real time.

With over one trillion unique URLs currently active on the web, technology that automatically personalizes and improves the precision of search engine results in real time meets a fundamental need for faster, easier and more effective searching. Since its release in February 2008, over 400,000 people have downloaded the Surf Canyon software.

v2.0 features explicit personalization, available through [http://my.SurfCanyon.com](http://my.SurfCanyon.com), which allows users to both specify preferred domains and block domains they dislike. Pages from preferred domains are automatically moved up in the Surf Canyon-enhanced list of search results and pages from disliked domains are removed. No longer are searchers required to contend with generic “one size fits all” search engine responses.

The new version also offers enhanced performance and advanced search personalization algorithms that further improve users’ search experiences. A new “Odometer” will furthermore offer a metric, called “Search Boost,” designed to help users understand the “mileage” and value they’re getting from Surf Canyon.

“We’re constantly refining our search technology to enable increasingly accurate inferences of searchers’ ‘at the moment’ intent, but our basic philosophy hasn’t changed: deliver real value, integrate transparently into the search experience, and require no learning curve or effort whatsoever on the part of our users,” said Mark Cramer, CEO of Surf Canyon.

Surf Canyon works with the most popular search engines, including Google, Yahoo!, Microsoft Live and Craigslist, and integrates seamlessly into Firefox and Internet Explorer. Surf Canyon has been a Featured Download at popular technology review site Lifehacker.com, is currently on Mozilla’s list of “Recommended Add-ons” (an honor bestowed on a mere 1½% of the 2500+ available) and is recognized by DEMO.com as an “Innovator to Watch.”
