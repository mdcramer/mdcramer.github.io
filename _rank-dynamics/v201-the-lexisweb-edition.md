It's been over ten weeks since our last release of [Surf Canyon](http://www.surfcanyon.com), but the latest version ([v2.0.1](http://www.surfcanyon.com/search/versions.jsp)) was pushed out today. The most notable enhancement is support for [Lexis Web](http://www.lexisweb.com), a new freely-available legal search engine where you can search legal-oriented web sites that are determined by [LexisNexis](http://www.lexis.com/) to be trustworthy and authoritative.

Also, for Internet Explorer, the native navigation has been restored to the bottom of the page, which has been the case with Firefox since version [1.1.3](http://blog.surfcanyon.com/2008/08/22/v113-released/).Â  Lastly, for Firefox, the text at the top of the search page that says "Results 1 to 10 of 20,000,000" is now updated to reflect the actual number of search results on the page.
